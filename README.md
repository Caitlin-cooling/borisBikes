# Boris Bikes

London's [Boris Bikes](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles) (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

Below are some user stories, your challenge is to implement an app that replicates the functionality of Boris Bikes, using whatever technology you like. Note that there is potentially too many users stories to get through in 2 hours but give it a go!
